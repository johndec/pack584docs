# Cub Scout Pack 584 Parent Handbook

## Welcome to Cub Scout Pack 584

Hi, and welcome to Cub Scout Pack 584! 
Here's hoping the information and guidelines presented to you in the next few pages will help you get off to a good start
for the coming year. Please keep this packet as a handy reference for future information needs regarding Pack policy and
uniform information. Thank you.

To begin with, your child is a member of Pack 584, which is in the North Lakes District, belonging to the Chief Seattle Council,
which encompasses King County. The Pack is made up of Dens, which is a group of children usually in the same grade as that
of your child.  Each Den has a specific numeral attached to it. Collectively, we are Cub Scouts, and are members of the
National organization, the Boy Scouts of America.

All Packs have a Chartered Organization which acts as a 'sponsor', and ours is the First Lutheran Church of Bothell located
at 10207 NE 183rd Street, Bothell, WA. 

The Pack is run by the registered BSA Adult Leaders of the Pack who make up the Pack Committee, which includes a
Committee Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, Trainer, Awards coordinator, Event coordinators, as well as the Cubmaster, Den leaders,
Assistant Den Leaders, and others. All parents of a Cub Scout in Pack 584 are welcomed and encouraged to become a Committee Member. 
Our committee meetings are typically held the first Monday following the Pack meeting of each month at 7:00PM at
the First Lutheran Church and are open to all parents of Scouts in Pack 584.

Den meetings are typically held weekly on different days of the week usually at the First Lutheran Church in the Fellowship
Hall (the basement) at 7:00PM. Unless previously announced, our Pack meetings are always the third Thursday of every month at
First Lutheran Church of Bothell in the Fellowship Hall (the basement) at 7:00PM.

## A Brief Summary of Scouting

The Boy Scouts of America was founded in 1910, and became federally chartered with the United States in 1916.
Cub Scouts came into being in 1930. Millions of boys have worn the uniform, cooked over an open fire at a campsite,
earned their Bobcat rank, raced their Pinewood Derby cars, worked on service projects, and made new friends under the
umbrella of Scouting.

Flowing underneath all this fun and excitement is a character-building program that encourages making good ethical choices,
family strengthening, physical fitness, and citizenship skills in the lives of our children.

On October 11, 2017, the BSA Board of Directors unanimously voted on inviting girls into all the Scouting programs.
Pack 584 is proud to be a Family Pack, inviting girls into our Cub Scout program starting in the 2018-2019 program year.

>"This decision is true to the BSA's mission and core values outlined in the Scout Oath and Law.
>The values of Scouting – trustworthy, loyal, helpful, kind, brave and reverent, for example – are important for
>both young men and women.  
>We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences
>for their children. We strive to bring what our organization does best – developing character and leadership for young people – 
>to as many families and youth as possible as we help shape the next generation of leaders."

Scouting utilizes an advancement system that requires a Scout to 'do their best' to fulfill and complete the requirements
outlined in their handbook so that he/she may earn their rank badge. After receiving his/her badge, these Scouts can go on
to earn other awards by completing a series of electives. 

During den meetings, Scouts will be playing games, building craft projects, learning songs, and working on rank
requirements.  In doing so, Scouts will be improving on different skills as they learn to get along with others,
become more resourceful, and participate in new activities and venues. 

Pack 584 follows a 'Scout year' of September to June, and upon nearing the end of the school term, all Scouts 'cross over'
into the next rank. During the summer, Den meetings are usually suspended.  The Pack will meet at fun outings such as a
Pack Campout, Pack Picnic, Cub Scout Day Camp, 4th of July Parade, Cub Scout Resident Camp, Day hikes and more
throughout the summer.
