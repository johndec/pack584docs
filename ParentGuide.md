# Cub Scout Pack 584 Parent Handbook

## Welcome to Cub Scout Pack 584

Hi, and welcome to Cub Scout Pack 584! 
Here's hoping the information and guidelines presented to you in the next few pages will help you get off to a good start
for the coming year. Please keep this packet as a handy reference for future information needs regarding Pack policy and
uniform information. Thank you.

To begin with, your child is a member of Pack 584, which is in the North Lakes District, belonging to the Chief Seattle Council,
which encompasses King County. The Pack is made up of Dens, which is a group of children usually in the same grade as that
of your child.  Each Den has a specific numeral attached to it. Collectively, we are Cub Scouts, and are members of the
National organization, the Boy Scouts of America.

All Packs have a Chartered Organization which acts as a 'sponsor', and ours is the First Lutheran Church of Bothell located
at 10207 NE 183rd Street, Bothell, WA. 

The Pack is run by the registered BSA Adult Leaders of the Pack who make up the Pack Committee, which includes a
Committee Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, Trainer, Awards coordinator, Event coordinators, as well as the Cubmaster, Den leaders,
Assistant Den Leaders, and others. All parents of a Cub Scout in Pack 584 are welcomed and encouraged to become a Committee Member. 
Our committee meetings are typically held the first Monday following the Pack meeting of each month at 7:00PM at
the First Lutheran Church and are open to all parents of Scouts in Pack 584.

Den meetings are typically held weekly on different days of the week usually at the First Lutheran Church in the Fellowship
Hall (the basement) at 7:00PM. Unless previously announced, our Pack meetings are always the third Thursday of every month at
First Lutheran Church of Bothell in the Fellowship Hall (the basement) at 7:00PM.

## A Brief Summary of Scouting

The Boy Scouts of America was founded in 1910, and became federally chartered with the United States in 1916.
Cub Scouts came into being in 1930. Millions of boys have worn the uniform, cooked over an open fire at a campsite,
earned their Bobcat rank, raced their Pinewood Derby cars, worked on service projects, and made new friends under the
umbrella of Scouting.

Flowing underneath all this fun and excitement is a character-building program that encourages making good ethical choices,
family strengthening, physical fitness, and citizenship skills in the lives of our children.

On October 11, 2017, the BSA Board of Directors unanimously voted on inviting girls into all the Scouting programs.
Pack 584 is proud to be a Family Pack, inviting girls into our Cub Scout program starting in the 2018-2019 program year.

>"This decision is true to the BSA's mission and core values outlined in the Scout Oath and Law.
>The values of Scouting – trustworthy, loyal, helpful, kind, brave and reverent, for example – are important for
>both young men and women.  
>We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences
>for their children. We strive to bring what our organization does best – developing character and leadership for young people – 
>to as many families and youth as possible as we help shape the next generation of leaders."
>
>-Michael Surbaugh, the BSA's Chief Scout Executive.

Scouting utilizes an advancement system that requires a Scout to 'do their best' to fulfill and complete the requirements
outlined in their handbook so that he/she may earn their rank badge. After receiving his/her badge, these Scouts can go on
to earn other awards by completing a series of electives. 

During den meetings, Scouts will be playing games, building craft projects, learning songs, and working on rank
requirements.  In doing so, Scouts will be improving on different skills as they learn to get along with others,
become more resourceful, and participate in new activities and venues. 

Pack 584 follows a 'Scout year' of September to June, and upon nearing the end of the school term, all Scouts 'cross over'
into the next rank. During the summer, Den meetings are usually suspended.  The Pack will meet at fun outings such as a
Pack Campout, Pack Picnic, Cub Scout Day Camp, 4th of July Parade, Cub Scout Resident Camp, Day hikes and more
throughout the summer. 

## Cub Scouting and You

When your Scout earns their Bobcat badge, they learn the Law of the Pack. One of these laws states "The Cub Scout Helps
the Pack Go". Throughout the year there are banquets, fundraisers, Scout shows, parades, derbies, camping trips,
and many other activities and functions. Ambitious as they are, a Cub Scout still needs your help in implementing
the program and thereby giving us the chance to keep our promise in the part of the Law that states "The Pack Helps
the Cub Scout Grow".

Remember, the Pack is all of us working together... leaders, parents, and Scouts.  Unlike other programs your child
might enroll in, Cub Scouting involves the whole family, no matter what size or parental make-up exists in the home.
In Tigers, you are your Scout's Adult Partner. In Wolves and Bears, you are Akela, the wise leader and the final
judge of your Scout's efforts. At the Webelos rank, you are the Activity Badge counselors that could help influence
a Scout's career direction.

Throughout the year, you will be asked to assist on different committees, and at different events. Please volunteer
freely, and give of yourself when called upon to help.  You will find it a rewarding experience, and one in which you
and your child will remember that you did together. Thank you. 

## Den Meetings

Lots of Cub Scouting happens in the den. Please remember that your child's Den Leader is a volunteer putting
forth his or her time and effort to help your boy 'do their best' to earn their badges, participate in the fun,
and gain all the positive values that the Cub Scout program offers. Please assist them in the following ways.

* _Please have your son arrive to den meetings on time._ Your den leaders have lots of activities planned
and it is important to have the whole group together to begin the evening's fun and projects.

* _Please pick up your child from den meetings on time._ Your den leader has places to go and kids that they
have to put to bed, too. Better yet, ask your den leader if they could use an extra pair of hands that night
and stay. Not only will your help be appreciated, but also you can see what your son is working on.  Note: 
Lions and Tigers must have an Adult Partner with them at all meetings, trips, etc. Enjoy the time together!

* _Please pay your den dues promptly._ Your den leader or other parents will be purchasing various items for
craft projects, supplies, snacks, etc., and it sure helps to have the money 'on hand'. Also, please make sure
your child has their handbook, and anything else they need for the meeting before leaving the house.

* _Be an active parent._ Everybody has some special abilities and 'know how' that can be of great help in
matters relating to Cub Scouts. Please make sure you have completed the Parent Talent Survey Sheet and return
it to your leader. In addition to the Scouts learning new skills from you, I promise that you will have a good
time helping them. 

## Pack Meetings

Whereas at weekly Den meetings the Scouts might do activities towards earning rank badges and awards, the
monthly Pack meeting is where these awards are presented. It is an important part of the program, as it allows
the Scouts to receive their recognition in front of the group as a whole, inspires the younger scouts to strive
towards achieving future ranks, and brings everybody together for the big night! 
 
At Pack meetings, the Cubmaster will 'do his/her best' to make sure that each Den has a chance to display that
special craft they made, song they learned, skit they've rehearsed, or interesting place they visited. In addition,
there might be a drawing, advancement ceremony, or other themed event planned for the evening.

Please observe the followings guidelines in regards to Pack meetings.  

* _Please accompany your Scout to his Pack meeting._ Pack meetings are a family event - brothers, sisters,
grandparents, but most of all, YOU! We require you there not only to help keep order at the meeting (things can get
a bit rowdy), but also because in Scouting some awards are presented to the parent who then presents it to the
Scout. Cub Scouts is a family program.  

* _Please arrive to Pack meetings on time._  Plan on arriving at least ten minutes early to receive a ticket for a
drawing that are sometimes held, confer with your child's Den leader about upcoming things, chat with friends, etc.,
as the meeting needs to begin on time. If your Scout is helping out as a member of a flag ceremony, or assisting
with other Pack meeting activities, it is imperative to have them there on time. Thank you.  

* _The Pack meeting is definitely the place to wear the full Scout uniform._  Class A - Shirts tucked in - looking sharp!
Most of all, we hope to make Pack meetings entertaining, enriching, and FUN!!!  

## Pack 584 and BSA Dues

Throughout the Scout year, your Den leader or Pack Treasurer will be collecting money for various Pack functions
and activities.  These will be addressed in flyers or newsletters that will be handed out at Pack Meetings or Den
meetings. The following is a reminder of what two fees are required for your child's involvement in the Pack.

The total annual fee is currently $90.00 (subject to change, year-to-year).  Please make checks payable to Cub Pack 584.

All direct-contact, adult leader volunteers (Den Leaders, Cubmaster, etc) will have their annual fee waived, and their
BSA Dues will be covered by the Pack.  The Pack will then send the required BSA Dues for you along with your registration.
This fee covers the following: 

* BSA Dues, $33.00 - This annual fee is for every Scout and Adult leader.  The adult leader's fee includes a subscription to Scouting magazine. This is pro-rated for new members based on time of registration.

* Pack 584 Dues, $57.00 - This part of the dues go towards the cost of the many awards that will be presented to your scout throughout the year as. This also helps offset some of the costs of other Pack events throughout the year including the Pinewood Derby. The deadline for this is the October Pack meeting. 

We do not want to exclude anyone based on their ability to pay these fees.  Please talk with the Cubmaster about our
low income assistance program if this applies to your family. 

The Pack maintains its own bank account with records being kept by our Pack Treasurer.

### Prorated Dues when joining Pack 584

If you join Pack 584, you might be joining in the middle of a program year (very common if joining in Fall).  We offer
prorated dues so that you don't spend an entire year's dues for a partial program year.  These prorated dues vary

* November: $110.  Same as above.
* December: $100.  Same as above.

## Fundraisers

Throughout the year there will be various fundraisers. Some of these might go to benefit the Pack for a trip, outing,
or needed supplies, and some to benefit the Scout, Pack, and Chief Seattle Council. As Cub Scouts, we will always try
and make sure to emphasize the **fun** in **fun**draising.  Thank you.
